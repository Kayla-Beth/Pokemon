# Pokemon

This is my Javascript project. Hosted at https://kayla-beth.github.io/Pokemon/ It uses the Pokemon TCG API (https://docs.pokemontcg.io/) to fetch either a random card or searches for a specific card. Then shows the card and the related data from the card object. I commented out some other HTML that was eventually going to be a virtual binder that you could add cards to from the search/random, but ran out of time.
